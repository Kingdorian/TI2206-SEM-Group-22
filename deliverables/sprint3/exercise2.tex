\section{Exercise 2 - Design Patterns}
\subsection{Exercise 2.1 - Strategy Pattern}
Before this sprint iteration, the project already contained a small implementation of the strategy pattern. The MovableUnit interface was already there to provide methods a Unit should implement if it can move on the screen. 

Since not every Unit can move, it is more flexible to add an interface for this. 
The methods for moving are not needed in classes such as Barricade. 
Instead of adding these methods in the superclass, it is better to add them in an interface so only subclasses implementing the interface, implement the methods.

The same can be done for shooting, and activating a unit on the player (such as a powerup).
The project was extended to include an interface for shooting, ShootableUnit and an interface for activating a unit on the player, ActivatableUnit.
