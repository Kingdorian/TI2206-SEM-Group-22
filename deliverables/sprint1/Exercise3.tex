\section*{Excercise 3}

To follow the responsibility driven design we started with the requirements for extending our game with a logger.
Looking at the requirements we came up with adding the following classes to our game:
\begin{itemize}
\item Logger
\item LogPlayer
\item LogAliens
\item LogBullets
\item LogBarricades
\item LogExplosions
\item LogExceptions
\item LogErrors
\item WriteLog
\item ReadLog
\end{itemize}

Next we are going to select the classes that we are actually going to use in our design. We will use the following classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Logger
\item WriteLog
\end{itemize}
