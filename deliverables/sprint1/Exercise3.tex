\section*{Excercise 3}

To follow the responsibility driven design we started with the requirements for extending our game with a logger.
Looking at the requirements we came up with adding the following classes to our game:
\begin{itemize}
\item Logger
\item LogPlayer
\item LogAliens
\item LogBullets
\item LogBarricades
\item LogExplosions
\item LogExceptions
\item LogErrors
\item WriteLog
\item ReadLog
\end{itemize}

Next we are going to select the classes that we are actually going to use in our design. We will use the following classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Logger
\item WriteLog
\end{itemize}

For these classes we created the following list of the classes with their responsibilities and collaborations:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | p{3cm} | p{5cm} | p{3cm} | p{2cm} | p{2cm} |}
  \hline
  Class & Responsibility & Collaborates with & Super & Sub \\ \hline
  Logger & Log all the actions in the game & WriteLog & & \\ \hline
  WriteLog & Write the log to a file & Logger & & \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{document}
