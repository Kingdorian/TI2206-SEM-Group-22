\section*{Excercise 2}
Each class we split into several subclasses will have one single responsibility. \\
Game:
\subsection*{Controller}
Controller: this interface class will provide template for the Controller classes of different game elements. 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item UnitController: this abstract class has the responsibility of controlling the non moving units in the game
	\item MovingUnitController: this interface has the responsibility of controlling the moving units in the game. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item ExplosionController: this class is responsible for modifying the explosions in the game.
			\item BarricadeController: this class is responsible for modifying the 	barricades in the game.
			\item AlienController: this class has the responsibility of modifying the aliens in the game.
			\item SpaceShipController: this class is responsible for modifying the spaceship.
			\item BulletController: this class is responsible for modifying the bullets in the game.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item AlienBulletController this class is responsible for modifying the alienbullets in the game.
				\item SpaceShipBulletController this class is responsible for modifying th spaceshipbullets in the game.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Unit}
The change we want to apply to the subclasses of the Unit class is making an interface movable that is implemented by units that move.
\subsection*{GameUiController}
Draw:
\begin{itemize}
	\item UiElement: this (abstract) clas is responsible for drawing all the ui parts on the screen.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item UiElementUnit: this abstract class is responsible for the units on the screen.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item UiElementAlien: this class is responsible for drawing the aliens on the screen.
				\item UiElementSpaceShip: this class is responsible for drawing the spaceship on the screen.
				\item UiElementBarricade: this class is responsible for drawing the barricades on the screen.
				\item UiElementExplosion: this class is responsible for drawing the explosions on the screen.
				\item UiElementBullet: this abstract class is responsible for drawing the bullets on the screen.
				\begin{itemize}
					\item UiElementSpaceShipBullet: this class is responsible for drawing the SpaceShipBullets on the screen.
					\item UiElementShipBullet: this class is responsible for drawing the SpaceShipBullets on the screen.
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item DrawScore: this class is responsible the score on the screen.
	\item DrawLives: this class is responsible the lives on the screen.
