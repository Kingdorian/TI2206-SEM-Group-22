\section*{Main Problems Encountered}
\subsection*{Problem 1}
\textbf{Description:}
Because of the large amount of changes that were made, merging took relatively long. Because of this, we could not ensure that the quality of the overall product was increased as much as we wanted.\\
\textbf{Reaction:} 
It would be better to aim for less changes and more quality in future iterations of the Scrum process.

\subsection*{Problem 2}
\textbf{Description:}
Changes to the user interface were made by Ege, who did not know the structure of the User Interface files. Because of this, it became a complex operation to refactor the UI.\\
\textbf{Reaction:} 
It would be better to make changes to the user interface together with someone who knows exactly how the User Interface was built or extend the UML so that it includes the UI.

\section*{Adjustments for the next Sprint Plan}
\begin{itemize}
\item Smaller changes, so that the quality of individual changes increases.
\item Assign more time to each task, so it is easier to determine the actual effort.
\end{itemize}
