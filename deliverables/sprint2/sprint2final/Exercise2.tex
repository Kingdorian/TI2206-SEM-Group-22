\section*{Exercise 2 - Your wish is my command}
The following new classes were created for the implementation of the PowerUp feature.
In the table the responsibilities and collaborations are presented for every class.

\section{Powerup Functional Requirements}

A list of functional requirements considered for the implementation of powerups using the MoSCoW method described in the previous section.

\subsection{Must Haves}
Powerups must meet the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Aliens shall randomly drop a powerup upon death.
	\item A Powerup buff shall be applied upon collision with the spaceship.
	\item A Powerup shall disappear upon collision with the spaceship.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Should Haves}
Powerups should meet the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Player velocity shall increase for a feasible amount of time upon collision with a Speed Powerup.
	\item Player shooting speed shall increase for a feasible amount of time upon collision with a Shooting Powerup.
	\item Player life shall increase upon collision with a Life Powerup.
	\item Player life shall not increase if the maximum amount of 5 lives has been reached.
	\item A Powerup shall have a custom sprite based on its type.
	\item A Powerup shall not disappear upon collision with a bullet.
	\item A Powerup shall not disappear upon collision with an alien.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Could Haves}
Powerups could meet the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Powerup shall explode upon hitting a barricade.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Would/Won't Haves}
Powerups won't meet the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A Powerup shall explode upon colliding with a bullet.
\end{itemize}
